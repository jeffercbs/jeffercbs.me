  "ABOUT_DESC": "<p><strong>My name is Jeferson Barrero</strong>, but my friends call me Jef. My journey into programming began at the age of 14, self-taught and inspired by figures like <strong>Freddy Vegas</strong> while exploring the web. This early immersion into the fascinating world of programming was my first window into digital creativity.</p><p>As a student at <strong>PLATZI</strong> and participant in the project '<strong>MisiónTIC2022</strong>', backed by the Colombian government and <strong>MINTIC</strong>, I have gained solid knowledge in <strong>programming</strong> and <strong>web development</strong>. Actively participating in personal and collaborative projects with clients has been crucial to strengthening my skills, not only as a <strong>programmer</strong> but also in creating unique applications.</p><p>Complementing this journey with additional virtual courses from <strong>SENA</strong> and currently studying <strong>3D modeling</strong> for the industry, I aspire to excel in the field of <strong>web development</strong> and <strong>programming</strong>. My vision includes not only personal growth but also actively contributing to the community. As an active collaborator on <strong>GitHub</strong>, I participate in projects aimed at promoting <strong>free</strong> and <strong>open</strong> programming education.</p>",
